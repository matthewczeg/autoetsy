Incorporating an Unlimited Liability Company
INTRODUCTION
There are different ways to form a business in B.C., each
with its own advantages and disadvantages. Companies
can officially incorporate, or they can register as a sole
proprietorship or a partnership. The decision to incorporate
depends on the specific needs of the persons involved and
the goals of the company.
Companies are incorporated in B.C. according to the
provisions of the Business Corporations Act. Corporate
Registry staff are pleased to provide information and
help you to file documents, but cannot give business or
legal advice. Remember, there is no substitute for sound,
independent and professional advice.
The provincial government, in partnership with business
development groups, provides a wealth of information on
starting up or expanding a business. For more information,
visit the website www.smallbusinessbc.ca. There is
also information available on incorporating a company
at local chambers of commerce, stationery stores, and on
various related websites.
When a company is incorporated, it acquires all of the
powers of an individual, as well as an independent
existence – separate and distinct from its shareholders
– and an unlimited life expectancy. In other words, the
act of incorporation gives life to a legal entity known as
the corporation, commonly referred to as a “company”.
A company can acquire assets, go into debt, enter into
contracts, sue or be sued.
Compared to registering a sole proprietorship or a
partnership, incorporating a company includes higher startup costs related to professional fees for legal and accounting
services. Carrying on business as a company will increase
the number of filings you are required to make with the
Corporate Registry. For instance, the Business Corporations
Act requires all companies to file an annual report and also
to file any changes to the location of the company offices
and its directors. The company is also required to maintain
certain corporate records.
INFO 01 ULC (JUL 2023)
STEPS TO INCORPORATING A COMPANY
To incorporate a company in B.C., one or more persons
(called “the incorporators”) may form a company by
completing the following steps:
1. Request name approval and reservation;
2. Establish your company's articles;
3. Prepare an incorporation agreement;
4. File an Incorporation Application; and
5. Keep documents as part of your company's records.
This information package covers only the five basic steps
to incorporating a company and is not intended to be a
complete guide.
There are many other steps that must be considered when
incorporating, for example setting up minute or records
books, establishing a central securities register, issuing share
certificates, getting consents from directors, etc.
Again, Corporate Registry staff are pleased to help you file
the incorporation application, but cannot provide you with
guidance or advice on these other essential steps.
STEP 1: REQUEST NAME APPROVAL AND
RESERVATION
If the company intends to use a specific name, that name
must be approved and reserved by the Corporate Registry.
This is to ensure the company’s name can be distinguished
from the names of other incorporated companies and that
the name meets specific guidelines established by the
registrar of companies.
Approval of a name by the registrar for the incorporation of
a business does not provide a proprietary right or interest
in the name. The approval is solely intended to prevent
names of incorporated businesses from being so similar as to
confuse or mislead the public.
This means another business operating in B.C. or elsewhere,
that is not incorporated or registered with the Corporate
Registry could use the same or similar name as your
business.
If it is important to protect your name outside B.C., or from
any other unregistered or unincorporated business in B.C.,
then you should contact Industry Canada for information on
trademarks. Their website address is www.strategis.ic.gc.ca.
The liability of the shareholders of an unlimited
liability company incorporated in B.C. differs greatly
from the liability of shareholders for a regular limited company. Refer to section 51.3 of the Business
Corporations Act for information regarding liability of
shareholders of unlimited liability companies.

2
The name reservation is for a period of 56 days. The other
steps in the incorporation process must be completed and
the Incorporation Application must be electronically filed
before the 56 day period ends.
An unlimited liability company must have the words
"Unlimited Liability Company" or the abbreviation "ULC"
as part of and at the end of its name. An unlimited
liability company must not have the word "Limited",
"Limitée", "Incorporated", "Incorporée", or "Corporation", or
abbreviation "Ltd.", "Ltée", "Inc." or "Corp." as part of and at
the end of its name.
A company can also choose to use as its name, the
incorporation number of the company followed by “B.C.
Unlimited Liability Company” ("0123456 B.C. Unlimited
Liability Company" for example). If you choose to use the
incorporation number as the company’s name, you do not
need a name approval and reservation. The incorporation
number is assigned by the Corporate Registry at the time
the Incorporation Application is electronically filed with the
Corporate Registry.
The Name Approval Request form attached allows you to
make a maximum of three choices of names, in descending
order of preference. Please read the Name Approval Request
Instructions sheet carefully before making your three
choices. The filing fee for this form is $30.00.
You can apply for the company’s name in the following ways:
Online options:
\ Submit your Name Approval Request electronically through
Name Requests Online at www.bcregistrynames.gov.bc.ca.
Payment is by credit card. There is online information you can
access to help you through the process. The fee to submit online
is $30.00 and a BC OnLine service fee of $1.50.
\ If you have a BC OnLine account you can submit your request
electronically at www.bconline.gov.bc.ca.
In-person options:
\ Visit your local Service BC Centre. Once you've paid the fee, they
will submit your request to the Corporate Registry. For a location

Mailing options

PO Box 9431 Stn Prov Govt
Victoria BC V8W 9V3.
For information regarding completing your Name
Approval Request form, contact the Corporate Registry at
1 877 526-1526.
Corporate Registry staff cannot provide legal or business
advice.
STEP 2: ESTABLISH YOUR COMPANY'S
ARTICLES
Every company must have a set of articles. The company’s
articles are the rules that govern the conduct of the
company and its shareholders, directors and officers.
For small companies, namely those that have only one
shareholder or where the officers are all family members, the
standard set of Table 1 Articles prescribed in the Business
Corporations Regulation is usually a suitable set of articles.
A sample of the Table 1 standard set of articles from the
Business Corporations Regulation is attached.
The articles must be kept by the company as part of the
company’s records.
STEP 3: PREPARE AN INCORPORATION
AGREEMENT
Before a company can be formed there must be an
incorporation agreement signed by each incorporator. This
is required even if there is only one incorporator. Usually the
incorporator(s) will also be the shareholder(s) and director(s)
once the company is incorporated. The Business Corporations
Act specifies that this incorporation agreement must contain:
\ The agreement of each incorporator to take one or more shares
of the company;
\ The signature of each incorporator opposite their full name,
along with the date each incorporator signed the agreement;
and
\ The number of shares of each class being taken by each
incorporator.
A sample incorporation agreement is attached.
The Table 1 Articles are meant to be adopted without
amending the document. If you want to customize
the articles for the company, it is recommended you
seek legal advice.

The Notice of Articles for a B.C. unlimited liability
company must contain a statutory description of
shareholder liability. The following statement will appear on the Notice of Articles issued by the registrar,
and the company must also put this statement on
the face of each share certificate issued by it:
The shareholders of this company are jointly and severally liabable to satisfy the debts and liabilities of this
company to the extent provided in section 51.3 of the
Business Corporations Act.

3
The incorporation agreement must be kept by the company
as part of the company’s records.
STEP 4: FILE AN INCORPORATION
APPLICATION
The next step in the process of incorporating company
is to file an Unlimited Liability Company Incorporation
Application with the Corporate Registry.
The Incorporation Application must be submitted
electronically over the Internet by visiting Corporate Online
at www.corporateonline.gov.bc.ca. The Corporate Online
site includes online help information to assist you with
completing and filing the online application form. When the
filing is completed, the company is incorporated and you
will be assigned an incorporation number at that time.
At the end of the electronic filing, you will be asked to set a
password for the company that will let you file other forms
for the company using Corporate Online. You should also set
a password “hint” that can be displayed back to you if you
forget your password.
It is also recommended you enter an email address. That
way if you forget the password, it can be emailed to you.
Otherwise, the only way to retrieve the password for the
company is to have it mailed to the company’s registered
office mailing address.
It is recommended that you complete the paper version of
the Incorporation Application first and use it for reference
when you electronically file the Incorporation Application. A
copy of this form is attached.
If you are not able to file electronically, you may prepare the
forms on paper and, once the forms are completed, visit
bcregistry.gov.bc.ca/filing for your service options. Please
note that Service BC does not provide legal or financial
advice.
STEP 5: KEEP DOCUMENTS AS PART OF YOUR
COMPANY'S RECORDS
After you have filed the Incorporation Application
electronically and the company is incorporated, the
Corporate Registry will send you the original Certificate
of Incorporation, a certified copy of the Incorporation
Application and a certified copy of the Notice of Articles.
These documents must be kept by the company as part of
the company’s records.
An incorporation number for the company is displayed in
the upper right hand corner of the Certificate of
Incorporation.
INFO 01 ULC (JUL 2023)
and on the cover sheet accompanying the documents. You
will need the incorporation number of the company when
filing other documents with the Corporate Registry. You will
also be prompted for the company password when filing any
changes to the company on Corporate Online.
The cover sheet also includes the Business Number issued
by Canada Revenue Agency. This is a nine-digit number
followed by a six-digit number. It is the first nine digits that
are important to other government agencies, you may be
asked for this number if dealing with the Ministry of Finance
for PST, WorkSafeBC or applying for a GST number or other
accounts at Canada Revenue Agency.
FEES
The fee to incorporate a company by filing an Incorporation
Application using Corporate Online is $1,000.00 and
a BC OnLine service fee of $1.50. You will need a valid
credit card and you will be asked to enter the credit card
information at the end of the transaction.
If you are filing with paper forms, visit bcregistry.gov.bc.ca/
filing for your service options. Please note that lawyers and
registry agents may charge additional fees.

User
is it normal to form a LLC or ULC and in the application of said business you're describing the business plan as being a company with intent to just aquire equity and hold that equity? im not sure if it should be worded that way if it is common or not
ChatGPT
Forming a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or an Unlimited Liability Company (ULC) with the primary intent of acquiring and holding equity in other companies is indeed a common and legitimate business model. Such entities often function as holding companies. A holding company's purpose is generally to own shares of other companies to form a corporate group, manage those companies, or invest in various business ventures without directly engaging in their operations. This structure can offer strategic advantages, such as risk management, tax planning, and simplified management of diverse business interests.

Description of Business Purpose in Application:
When articulating the business purpose in the application or incorporation documents, the wording can indeed include the intent to acquire and hold equity. However, it's crucial to ensure that the description is both accurate and sufficiently broad to encompass potential future activities, without being misleading or too vague. A well-crafted purpose statement provides clarity to regulatory bodies, potential investors, and other stakeholders about the company's primary business activities.

Example Wording:
For an LLC or ULC whose primary business is to acquire and hold equity, you might describe the company's purpose as follows:

"The company is formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding, and managing equity interests in various companies. This includes but is not limited to providing strategic, financial, and operational support to its subsidiaries or associated companies. The company may also engage in any lawful activities incidental to the foregoing."

Considerations:
Regulatory Compliance: Ensure the business purpose complies with the laws and regulations of the jurisdiction where the company is incorporated. Some jurisdictions might have specific requirements or restrictions on the activities a company can engage in based on its stated purpose.

Flexibility: While being specific enough to convey the company's primary activities, the purpose statement should also be broad enough to allow for future growth and diversification within the legal framework.

Professional Advice: Given the legal and financial implications, consulting with legal professionals and accountants experienced in corporate structuring and business planning is advisable. They can provide guidance on the most suitable wording and structure based on your business goals and legal requirements.

It is common for businesses, especially holding companies, to be established with the primary intent of owning shares in other companies. The key is to ensure that the incorporation documents accurately reflect this purpose while adhering to legal standards and providing the company with the flexibility to pursue its strategic objectives.

User
ok lets also add in the flexibility to use this company to do tech consulting either for profit or as an advisory status that would then be taking on additional equity in other companies that may need to hire our tech consulting services
ChatGPT
Incorporating the flexibility to engage in tech consulting directly, either for profit or in an advisory capacity that could lead to acquiring equity in other companies, is a strategic move. It broadens the company's operational scope beyond just holding equity. This approach can be particularly appealing in dynamic sectors like technology, where consulting can also lead to investment and partnership opportunities.

Adjusted Business Purpose Description
Here’s how you might adjust the company's purpose in the incorporating documents to reflect this expanded role:

"The purpose of the company is to engage in acquiring, holding, and managing equity interests in various companies, as well as providing technology consulting and advisory services. These services may be offered on a for-profit basis or as part of strategic equity agreements with client companies. The company aims to leverage its expertise in technology to support and enhance the value of its investments and its consulting clientele. In addition to these activities, the company may also undertake any lawful activities incidental to the foregoing, which may contribute to the company's growth and objectives."

Key Considerations for Incorporation Documents:
Broad Operational Scope: This wording allows the company to operate both as a holding company and a consulting firm. It provides clear insight into the dual nature of the business, offering both services and holding equity in companies that might be clients or strategic partners.

Flexibility for Strategic Decisions: The inclusion of a broad range of lawful activities related to the company's core purposes ensures flexibility for future strategic decisions, such as diversifying service offerings or entering new markets.

Clarity for Legal and Financial Planning: A clear articulation of the company's purpose assists in legal compliance and financial planning, including tax considerations. It helps in setting up appropriate legal structures for different aspects of the business and in communicating with investors and regulatory bodies.

Next Steps:
Consult with Professionals: It’s important to work with legal and financial advisors to refine the company's purpose and ensure it aligns with regulatory requirements, especially since your business model encompasses both holding equity and active consulting services.

Consider the Structure: Depending on your goals and the legal environment, your advisors might suggest specific structures for the consulting and holding aspects of your business to optimize for taxes, liability, and operational efficiency.

Regulatory Compliance: Ensure all activities, especially those related to holding equity in other companies and providing consulting services, comply with the relevant laws and regulations, including securities laws and professional service regulations.

By articulating a broad yet clear business purpose in your incorporation documents, you can set a strong foundation for your company’s activities, providing the flexibility to navigate and adapt to the evolving tech landscape.
